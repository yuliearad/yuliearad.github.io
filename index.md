### About Me
I'm a master's student in computer science at UIUC with a passion for robotics, quantum computing, and algorithms. I graduated from UIUC with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics in May 2024. 

I joined the [Parasol Lab](https://parasollab.web.illinois.edu/) in spring 2023. Through the mentorship of Professors [Nancy Amato](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/namato), I have been able to develop a deep passion for sampling-based motion planning.

My passion for education runs deeper than just my personal love for learning. After 8 years of tutoring, and helping countless students in topics ranging from third grade math to college calculus, I have learned a great deal about the world of education. I am particularly enthusiastic about expanding access to education for everyone.
